###     *** Variables & Functions Visibility ***

There are four visibility specifiers for functions and state variables: 

1. Public
    - The function is part of the contract interface and can be called both internally (from within the same contract) and externally (from other contracts or by EOA accounts);
    - A getter is automatically created for public variables. They can be easily accessed from dApps;

2. Private
    - Private functions and variables are available only in the contract they are defined.
    - This is the default for state variables, they can be accessed only by a getter function;

3. Internal
    - Functions are accessible only from the contract they are defined in and from derived contracts;

4. External
    - The function is part of the contract interface, can be accessed only from other contracts or by EOA accounts using transactions. Itâ€™s automatically public;
    - Not-available for state variables;


###     *** Variables & Functions Visibility (cont) ***

    - Everything that is inside a contract is visible to all external observers. Making something private only prevents other contracts from accessing and modifying the information, but it will still be visible to the whole world outside of the blockchain;

    - Information is not encrypted by default on the Ethereum Blockchain;
    
    - The visibility specifier is given after the type for state variables and between parameter list and return parameter list for functions;
    
    - External functions are more efficient than public functions in terms of gas consumption;
