###     *** Contract Address ***

- Any contract has its own unique address that is generated at deployment.

- The contract address is generated based on the address of the account that deploys the contract and the no. of transactions of that account (nonce). It canâ€™t be calculated in advance.

- Address is a variable type and has the following members:
    + balance
    + If the address is declared payable it has two additional members:
        * transfer(): should be used in most cases as it's the safest way to send ether
        * send(): is like a low-level transfer(). If execution fails the contract will not stop and send() returns false;
    + call(), delegatecall(), staticcall()
