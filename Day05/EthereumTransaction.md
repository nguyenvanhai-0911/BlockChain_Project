### ***  Ethereum Transactions ***

- Transactions are the heart of the Ethereum Blockchain. Interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain means executing transactions that update the blockchain state.
- The term “transaction” is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an EOA to another account on the blockchain.
- Any transaction requires a fee to be paid (gas).
- Contracts have the ability to send “messages” to other contracts.
- An EOA produces a transaction and a contract produces a message.
