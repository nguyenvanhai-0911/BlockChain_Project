### *** Solidity Data Types: Booleans and Integers ***

● Solidity is a statically-typed language (variables type should be specified at declaration).

### *** Value Types:
● Boolean variables: true and false
    ○ Initialized by default with false.
● Signed and Unsigned Integers of various sizes.
    ○ int8 to int256, uint8 to uint256 in steps of 8.
    ○ int8 is between -128 and +127, int16 is between -32768 and +32767 and so on.
    ○ int is alias to int256 and uint is an alias to uint256.
    ○ By default an int is initialized with zero.
● There is no full support for float/double (fixed point numbers) in Solidity.
