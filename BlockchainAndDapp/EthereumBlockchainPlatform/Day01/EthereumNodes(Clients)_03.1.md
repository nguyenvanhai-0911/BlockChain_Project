###     *** Ethereum Nodes (Clients) ***

* Ethereum is a peer-to-peer network of computers named “Ethereum Nodes”. Anyone can run an Ethereum Node on its laptop or desktop machine (it require lots of resources).

* Every Ethereum Node runs an Ethereum Client such as geth.

* Types of Node:
1. Full Node
2. Light Node
3. Archive Node

* An Ethereum node runs a VM named EVM and runs applications (EVM bytecode) based on a global consensus mechanism. This EVM has its microkernel, stack, memory and storage.

* There are new clients for Ethereum 2.0 that run the Beacon and the Shard Chains and support the new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

* There are many different Ethereum Networks: Main Net, Test Nets (Rinkeby, Kovan), Private Ethereum Blockchains
