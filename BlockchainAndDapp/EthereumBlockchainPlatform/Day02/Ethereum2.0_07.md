### *** Ethereum 2.0 (ETH2 or Serenity) ***

- ETH2 is an upgrade to the initial Ethereum protocol.

- ETH2 aims to increase the speed, efficiency, and scalability.

* ETH2 Major Upgrades:
    1. PoS (Proof of Stake) instead of PoW (Proof of Work) 
    2. Sharding

* PoS (Proof of Stake)
    - Miners are called Validators.

    - To become a validator, you have to stake or lock an amount of ETH in a smart contract.

    - High performance hardware is not required to become a validator.

    - Rewards are given to the validators because that's what keeps the chain running securely. The more ETH you stake, the more 
    blocks you can validate.

    - A validator can loose ETH if he does bad things (going offline, failing to validate etc).

    - To conduct a 51% attack a validator needs to stake 51% of the staked ETH.
